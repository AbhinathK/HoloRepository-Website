                                    Recent technical advancements in the realm of augmented reality (AR) and the availability
                                    of consumer head-mounted display (HMD) devices such as the Microsoft HoloLens have opened
                                    a wealth of opportunities for healthcare applications, particularly in medical imaging.
                                    Several approaches have been proposed to transform imaging studies, such as CT or MRI
                                    scans, into three-dimensional models which can be inspected and manipulated in an AR
                                    experience [1â€“4]. Generally, all studies agree that the technology is very promising
                                    and may even revolutionise the practice of medicine [5]. However, virtually every
                                    existing workflow relies on significant manual guidance to conduct steps like segmentation
                                    or conversion to polygonal models.
                                </p>

                                <p style={{ fontSize: '1.2em' }}>
                                    Neural networks can help automate many tedious tasks and are increasingly used in medical
                                    imaging. Architectures such as the 3D U-Net [6] generate models which autonomously create
                                    segmentation maps, even with relatively little training data. However, translating these
                                    advancements from theory to clinical practice has unique challenges: The source code may
                                    not be available, documentation may be missing or require too much technical knowledge.
                                    Furthermore, different operating systems, software packages and dependencies obstruct
                                    successful usage [7].

                                    With the HoloRepository project, we intend to build the technical base for a seamless
                                    workflow that allows practitioners to generate 3D models from imaging studies and access
                                    them in an AR setting with as little manual involvement as possible. Pre-trained neural
                                    networks can be packaged into shareable Docker containers and accessed with a unified
                                    interface. Additionally, the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard,
                                    which is rapidly being adapted and also has a significant impact on the field of radiology [8],
                                    will connect the 3D models with existing patient health records.

                                Through the GUI interface, one can either process a new medical scan or open an existing hologram. 
                                The created objects can be viewed through a proof of concept hologram viewer built on top of vtkplotter. 
                                The 2D View will attempt to open the scan using the default program selected for the task. For this, we recommend mango.

                                The HoloRegistation 2020 application allows segmented organ models to be overlayed over the human body 
                                through an augmented reality experience. Organ models loaded can automatically locate themselves at the 
                                correct position and size, moving along with the user.  Itâ€™s design also allows for custom organ configurations 
                                to be added at anytime without any changes to code and it supports any type of camera, including webcams.
