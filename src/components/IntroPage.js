                                    Recent technical advancements in the realm of augmented reality (AR) and the availability
                                    of consumer head-mounted display (HMD) devices such as the Microsoft HoloLens have opened
                                    a wealth of opportunities for healthcare applications, particularly in medical imaging.
                                    Several approaches have been proposed to transform imaging studies, such as CT or MRI scans,
                                    into three-dimensional models which can be inspected and manipulated in an AR experience [1â€“4].
                                    Generally, all studies agree that the technology is very promising and may even revolutionise
                                    the practice of medicine [5]. However, virtually every existing workflow relies on significant
                                    manual guidance to conduct steps like segmentation or conversion to polygonal models.
                                </p>

                                <p style={{ fontSize: '1.2em' }}>
                                    Neural networks can help automate many tedious tasks and are increasingly used in medical
                                    imaging. Architectures such as the 3D U-Net [6] generate models which autonomously create
                                    segmentation maps, even with relatively little training data. However, translating these
                                    advancements from theory to clinical practice has unique challenges: The source code may
                                    not be available, documentation may be missing or require too much technical knowledge.
                                    Furthermore, different operating systems, software packages and dependencies obstruct
                                    successful usage [7].
                                </p>

                                    With the HoloRepository project, we intend to build the technical base for a seamless
                                    workflow that allows practitioners to generate 3D models from imaging studies and access
                                    them in an AR setting with as little manual involvement as possible. Pre-trained neural
                                    networks can be packaged into shareable Docker containers and accessed with a unified
                                    interface. Additionally, the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard,
                                    which is rapidly being adapted and also has a significant impact on the field of radiology [8],
                                    will connect the 3D models with existing patient health records.
