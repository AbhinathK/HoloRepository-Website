                                Recent technical advancements in the realm of augmented reality (AR) and the availability
                                of consumer head-mounted display (HMD) devices such as the Microsoft HoloLens have opened
                                a wealth of opportunities for healthcare applications, particularly in medical imaging.
                                Several approaches have been proposed to transform imaging studies, such as CT or MRI
                                scans, into three-dimensional models which can be inspected and manipulated in an AR
                                experience [1â€“4]. Generally, all studies agree that the technology is very promising
                                and may even revolutionise the practice of medicine [5]. However, virtually every
                                existing workflow relies on significant manual guidance to conduct steps like segmentation
                                or conversion to polygonal models.
                            </p>

                                Neural networks can help automate many tedious tasks and are increasingly used in medical
                                imaging. Architectures such as the 3D U-Net [6] generate models which autonomously create
                                segmentation maps, even with relatively little training data. However, translating these
                                advancements from theory to clinical practice has unique challenges: The source code may
                                not be available, documentation may be missing or require too much technical knowledge.
                                Furthermore, different operating systems, software packages and dependencies obstruct
                                successful usage [7].

                                With the HoloRepository project, we intend to build the technical base for a seamless
                                workflow that allows practitioners to generate 3D models from imaging studies and access
                                them in an AR setting with as little manual involvement as possible. Pre-trained neural
                                networks can be packaged into shareable Docker containers and accessed with a unified
                                interface. Additionally, the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard,
                                which is rapidly being adapted and also has a significant impact on the field of radiology [8],
                                will connect the 3D models with existing patient health records.
